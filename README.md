# Portfolio Website - Built with Astro

## Overview

This portfolio website is a showcase of my professional work and skills, redesigned and rebuilt using the Astro framework. Originally developed in React, I sought a more efficient and faster solution for a statically generated site, leading me to choose Astro.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern framework designed for building faster websites with less client-side JavaScript. It allows for building static sites with various frontend frameworks (including React) but delivers them with significantly better performance.

## Challenges in Adopting Astro

### Learning Curve
- **New Syntax and Concepts:** Adapting to Astro's unique blend of HTML, JavaScript, and component architecture required an adjustment period.
- **Understanding Rendering Modes:** Grasping the different rendering modes (Static, SSR, SSG) and applying them effectively was a learning process.

### Integrating with Existing Knowledge
- **React Integration:** Leveraging my React skills within Astro's environment, balancing server-side and client-side rendering.
- **Routing and Layouts:** Adapting to Astro's approach to routing and layouts, which differs from React's single-page application (SPA) model.

### Optimizing Performance
- **Efficient Asset Management:** Learning to manage assets efficiently in Astro, including images, styles, and scripts.
- **Optimizing for Speed:** Implementing best practices in Astro to ensure the site loads quickly and runs smoothly.

### Debugging and Troubleshooting
- **New Debugging Techniques:** Familiarizing myself with Astro-specific debugging techniques and tools.
- **Community and Resources:** Navigating the relatively new and growing community and resources for troubleshooting.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains all the source code for the website.
- `src/pages/`: Astro pages for each section of the portfolio.
- `src/components/`: Reusable components, some from my previous React project.
- `public/`: Static assets like images and global CSS.

## Running the Project

1. **Installation**: Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. **Development**: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. **Build**: Run `npm run build` to create a production build.

## Conclusion

Transitioning to Astro brought both challenges and learning opportunities. The effort has paid off in terms of performance gains and a more efficient development process. I'm excited to see how Astro evolves and to continue refining my site with its capabilities.
